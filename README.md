# blocks-script
Scripting support for use with PIXILAB BlocksÂ®, including custom device drivers and user scripts.

**IMPORTANT**: In general, you should not activate drivers or user scripts by moving those from their xxx-archive directories into their active directories (i.e., driver and user) unless you need their functionality. In particular, user scipts are activated by merely moving them to the user directory. Active user scripts may consume system resources or cause problems if used in an incorrect manner.

### Additional Preparations for Development
If you plan on doing development of drivers/scripts, there's an additional step required after cloning/downloading/installing these files. You must then also run the *npm install* command from within the *script* directory to download and install any development dependencies, as specified by the package.json file. If such dependencies are not installed, you may get TypeScript compilation errors.
